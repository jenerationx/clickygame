# Clicky Game

## Overview

In this assignment, I created a web app that challenges users to a memory game.  

## How it works:
- Users click on any card to start the game
- Each time they click on a card, the object is to not click on that card again
- If they click on each card only once, they win the game
- If they repeat a card, they will get a game over message and their score is reset to zero
